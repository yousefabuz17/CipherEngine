# CipherEngine

CipherEngine is a Python library that provides tools for encrypting and decrypting files and text data using symmetric key cryptography. It uses secure algorithms and includes features such as key derivation, salt generation, and file integrity checks.

## Features

- **File Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt files securely using symmetric key cryptography.

- **Text Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt text data with ease.

- **Passphrase Generation**: Generate secure passphrases with customizable options.

- **Key Derivation**: Implement key derivation functions for enhanced security.

- **Backup and Restore**: Optionally create backups of original files before encryption and restore them during decryption.

- **Export Passphrase**: Export passphrase to a separate file for convenient storage.
